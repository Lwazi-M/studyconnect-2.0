/**
 * FILE: src/app/globals.css
 * TITLE: Global Stylesheet (The Visual Rules)
 * PURPOSE: 
 * This file controls the look and feel of the entire application.
 * It does two main things:
 * 1. It loads Tailwind CSS, the tool we use to style everything (colors, spacing, fonts).
 * 2. It defines custom styles that Tailwind doesn't provide out of the box, 
 * such as hiding the ugly scrollbar to make the app feel like a real mobile app.
 */

/* @tailwind directives:
   These three lines tell the compiler to "inject" all of Tailwind's pre-written styles here.
   Think of this as importing a massive library of ready-to-use Lego bricks.
*/
@tailwind base;       /* Resets browser defaults (e.g., removes default margins on <body>) */
@tailwind components; /* Loads component classes (if any are defined) */
@tailwind utilities;  /* Loads the utility classes we use everywhere (e.g., 'text-center', 'flex', 'mt-4') */


/* --- CUSTOM UTILITIES --- */
/* You can add your own custom CSS below this line. */

/* CLASS: .no-scrollbar
   PURPOSE: Hides the physical scrollbar while still allowing the user to scroll.
   WHY? On mobile apps (like Instagram or WhatsApp), you rarely see a grey scrollbar 
   taking up space on the right. We hide it to make the "iPhone frame" look cleaner.
*/

/* For Chrome, Safari, and Opera browsers */
.no-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none; /* Completely hides the scrollbar */
}

/* For IE, Edge, and Firefox browsers */
.no-scrollbar {
    -ms-overflow-style: none;  /* IE and Edge */
