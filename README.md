## 📖 Overview

**StudyConnect 2.0** is the evolution of the original StudyConnect mobile application. While the original was a native Android app, Version 2.0 is a **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** built to solve the key challenge of **accessibility**.

By leveraging modern web technologies, we simulate a native mobile experience ("Digital Phone" interface) that runs instantly in any browser, removing the need for APK downloads while maintaining a premium, app-like feel.

### 🎯 Core Mission
To bridge the gap in academic support by connecting students with peers, resources, and study groups in a gamified, real-time environment.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

We have migrated from Java/Android Studio to a modern Full-Stack Web architecture:

* **Framework:** [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (React) - For server-side rendering and routing.
* **Language:** TypeScript - For type safety and robust code.
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For rapid, utility-first styling.
* **Design System:** Glassmorphism ("Apple Glass" aesthetic) with custom CSS effects.

## 📱 Features (Implemented So Far)

### ✅ Phase 1: The "Digital Phone" Interface
- [x] **Responsive Mobile Chassis:** A CSS-engineered iPhone-style frame that houses the app on desktop screens.
- [x] **Glassmorphism UI:** Implemented `backdrop-blur` and semi-transparent layers for a modern, liquid feel.
- [x] **Scrollable Viewport:** Independent scrolling within the phone frame, simulating native touch behavior.
